Noctalia
===

A lightweight Wayland shell and bar built directly on Wayland + OpenGL ES, with no Qt or GTK dependency.

Noctalia is in early development. Expect breaking configuration and behavior changes while the project is still taking shape.

Vendored dependencies, with no system package needed: `Wuffs`, `tomlplusplus`, `tinyexpr`,
`nlohmann/json`, `Luau`, `dr_wav`, `fzy`, `stb_image_resize2`, and Material Color Utilities.

System packages required beyond the Wayland/GL stack: `libwebp` handles WebP decoding and thumbnail encoding. Wuffs
handles the other supported raster image formats.

Polkit agent support requires development files that provide the `polkit-agent-1` and `polkit-gobject-1` pkg-config
modules. Some distros ship these in the runtime `polkit` package, while split-package distros use names such as
`polkit-devel`, `polkit-dev`, or `libpolkit-agent-1-dev` / `libpolkit-gobject-1-dev`.

`jemalloc` is recommended but optional. It reduces memory fragmentation in long-running sessions, and on glibc systems
it is used automatically when detected. Use Meson's `-Djemalloc=enabled` or `-Djemalloc=disabled` option to require or
disable it explicitly.

Sanitizer runtime packages are only needed for ASan/UBSan builds configured with `just configure asan`.

## Building and install

Requires [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/).

#### Release build
```sh
# Optimized release build in build-release/
just configure release
just build release

# After building, install. The install recipe does not build or reconfigure.
sudo just install release
```

Pass a prefix to `configure` to install somewhere other than `/usr/local`:

```sh
just configure release "$HOME/.local"
just build release
just install release
```

To remove files installed from a build directory, run `just uninstall release`.

#### Debug build
```sh
# Debug build in build-debug/ don't use debug unless you are debugging...
just configure
just build

# Test your local debug build with
just run
```

Meson installs the binary and shipped assets using the normal prefix layout:

```text
/usr/local/bin/noctalia
/usr/local/share/noctalia/assets/...
```

Noctalia needs the shipped `assets/` tree at runtime. Copying only the `noctalia` binary is not enough.

Portable bundle layouts are also supported:

```text
bundle/
  noctalia
  assets/
```

```text
bundle/
  bin/noctalia
  share/noctalia/assets/
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#runtime-assets) for the full runtime asset lookup order.

## Configuration

Noctalia has two configuration layers:

- Declarative user config lives in `$NOCTALIA_CONFIG_HOME/noctalia/`, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/noctalia/`, or
  `~/.config/noctalia/`.
  Noctalia reads every `*.toml` file in that directory, sorted alphabetically, and deep-merges them into one config.
  A single `config.toml` is the simplest setup, but splitting config into files such as `bar.toml`, `theme.toml`,
  or `widgets.toml` is also supported.
- GUI-managed overrides live in `$NOCTALIA_STATE_HOME/noctalia/settings.toml`,
  `$XDG_STATE_HOME/noctalia/settings.toml`, or `~/.local/state/noctalia/settings.toml`. This file is written by
  Noctalia itself for settings changed through the UI, IPC-backed controls, setup flows, and other runtime actions
  that need persistence.

Noctalia also keeps internal UI/runtime state in `$NOCTALIA_STATE_HOME/noctalia/state.toml`,
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/noctalia/state.toml`, or `~/.local/state/noctalia/state.toml`. This is app-owned state, not a
configuration layer, and it is not merged into the active config.

`NOCTALIA_CONFIG_HOME` and `NOCTALIA_STATE_HOME` are Noctalia-specific overrides with the same "home root" semantics
as the XDG variables. For example, `NOCTALIA_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/profile` loads config from
`/tmp/profile/noctalia/`. Prefer these variables over overriding `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` when launching Noctalia from a
session, because applications started through Noctalia's launcher inherit the shell environment.

Load order is built-in defaults first, then declarative config files, then `settings.toml`.
Because the override file is applied last, GUI overrides win over matching values in `config.toml`.

Use the declarative config directory for hand-authored, dotfile-managed configuration. Treat `settings.toml` as an
app-managed override layer: inspect or delete it when you want to understand or clear GUI changes, but do not rely on
it as the primary place for curated config. Treat `state.toml` as disposable app state: inspect it when debugging UI
state, or delete it to reset remembered UI state. Keeping these app-managed files outside `~/.config` also allows the
GUI to save changes when the config directory is read-only, such as on NixOS.

Both layers are watched for changes and hot-reloaded. If neither declarative config nor state overrides exist,
Noctalia falls back to built-in defaults in code.

A ready-to-use starting config with all defaults is at [example.toml](example.toml). The full configuration reference
lives in the [documentation site](https://docs.noctalia.dev/v5/).
